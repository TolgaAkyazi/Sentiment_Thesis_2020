# Sentiment_Thesis_2020

# The scripts are numbered in the order they were used in my personal research
# Script #1 is the classification of conspiratorial content; serves as baseline
# Script #2 and #3 are sentiment analyses, #2 -- negative, #3 -- positive
# Script #4 is a script which builds upon the pickles made by me with scripts #1, #2, #3
# Script #4 should be ran by itself for the weighted results 


# If all the modules are installed and all the directories are referred to correctly, the script should just run fine. 
# If it doesnt work, it is probably my fault
# Any questions, mail or whatsapp me! 

# Scripts #2 and #3 do not work, because of the lack of the IMDB dataset.
# Use pickles and #4 to perform weighted sentiment analysis 

# Thanks
